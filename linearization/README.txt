Within Arduino IDE, Motor's RPM is controlled by esc.writeMicroseconds(). By using a linear regression for (us, RPM) data points, we've found a function (fitModel[us]) that models the relation between us and the measured RPM (that is fitModel[us] ~ writeMicroseconds(us)). We've then calculated by hand it's inverse (inverseFunction[R]) which utilizes the fitted exponential parameter for fitModel. Now, by virtue of being it's inverse, fitModel[inverseFunction[R]] = R and as fitModel approximates writeMicroseconds, we have that writeMicroseconds(inverseFunction(R)) â‰ˆ R, that is, by using inverseFunction we're theoretically able to control the RPM directly.

The definitions of fitModel and inverseFunction (named W and W^-1, respectively) can be found within functionDefinitions.png.
